# Perception3D
An Open-Source Deep Learning Framework for 3D Perception (including classification, segmentation, keypoint detection, registration, shape matching, etc.). The documentation (beta) can be built in `docs` folder.
This framework is inspired by [mmdetection3d](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d), but with a better configuration system.

# Beta Development
We are still deleveloping this framework, and welcome any contribution of new models. 
Currently, DGCNN, PointNet, PointNet2, PointCNN are implemented.
