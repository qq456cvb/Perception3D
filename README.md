# Perception3D
An Open-Source Deep Learning Framework for 3D Perception (including classification, segmentation, keypoint detection, registration, shape matching, etc.). The documentation (beta) is held at [here](http://202.121.182.216:21369/build/html/).
This framework is inspired by [mmdetection3d](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d), but with a better [configuration system](http://202.121.182.216:21369/build/html/config.html).

# Beta Development
We are still deleveloping this framework, and welcome any contribution of new models. 
Currently, DGCNN, PointNet, PointNet2, PointCNN are implemented.

If you're interested in developing this framework, please contact me at qq456cvb@sjtu.edu.cn.
